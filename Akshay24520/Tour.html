        <h2>Q2. My Travel Experience - Guwahati</h2>
        <p>
            My recent trip to Guwahati, the gateway to Northeast India, was an unforgettable experience.
            Situated on the banks of the mighty Brahmaputra River, Guwahati is a perfect blend of natural beauty
            and cultural heritage. I visited the famous Kamakhya Temple, which sits atop the Nilachal Hill,
            offering breathtaking views of the city. The serene Umananda Island in the middle of the river was
            another highlight, where peace and nature go hand in hand. Evenings at the riverfront were magical,
            with cool breezes and glowing sunsets painting the sky in vibrant hues.
